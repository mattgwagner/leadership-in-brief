# Leadership in Brief

## A few notes from my foxhole

> <span style="font-size:1.8em;"> Leadership is influencing people—by providing purpose, direction and motivation—while operating to accomplish the mission and improving the organization. Influencing means getting people to do what you want them to do. Through your words and example, you must communicate purpose, direction and motivation. Purpose gives Soldiers a reason to do things. You must earn their trust and they know from experience that you care about them. Soldiers want direction. They want to be given challenging tasks, training in how to accomplish them and the resources necessary to do them well. Motivation gives subordinates the will to do everything they can to accomplish a mission. Motivate your Soldiers by giving them missions that are challenging. Leaders motivate their Soldiers by the examples they set. The best leaders lead from the front. It is important to be where the action is.</span>

# Setting Expectations: The Impact of Counseling

> Effective leadership largely hinges on the ability to set clear expectations from the outset. In the Army, this process is formally established through counseling sessions, particularly during the initial counseling.

- Initial counseling serves as a platform for leaders and subordinates to engage in discussions about roles, standards, and what achievement looks like.
- This process goes beyond mere checklist completion—when done effectively, it fosters a dialogue that builds trust, clarifies priorities, and encourages open and honest feedback.
- By establishing clear expectations, we can mitigate confusion, frustration, and the risk of underperformance in the future.

# Setting Expectations: A Leader's Toolbox

> "One of the greatest tools in a leader's kit bag is one-on-one counseling... When we don't provide subordinates with feedback, their professional growth is left up to chance."  
> — [From the Green Notebook](https://fromthegreennotebook.com/2019/05/23/turning-counseling-into-a-conversation/)

<br />

<span style="font-size:2em;">*The best counseling sessions are two-way conversations, not lectures. They invite reflection, feedback, and shared ownership of growth.*
</span>

# My Initial Counseling Template

- Utilize an initial counseling template to establish clear expectations with all team members.
- Based on personal experience, the template covers crucial elements for success.
- This approach is effective not only in the Army but also applicable to civilian management and leadership roles.
- Ensures clarity on:
  - What matters most for the team.
  - The criteria for success.
  - The collaborative working relationship and expectations.
---

# Duties & Responsibilities

- "Do what you are told and be where you are supposed to be, when you are supposed to be there, with what you need to accomplish the mission, ready to perform."
- Mission focus and reliability are non-negotiable.

---

# Communication

- Be reachable and respond in a timely manner—your feedback and knowledge are essential to the team.
- Communicate up and down the chain; keep your leader informed before issues escalate.
- If personal issues arise, let me know so we can adjust as needed.

---

# Military Bearing & Professionalism

- Know, understand, and enforce the standard—both Army regulations and local SOPs.
- Be physically and mentally prepared; set the example in appearance and conduct.
- *"A man in authority who lets his subordinates get away with poor performance implies in doing so that they and their actions are of no significance..."*

---

# Unit Esprit & Pride

# Plan of Action & Leader Responsibilities

- You are responsible for maintaining your support form and tracking your progress.
- Leaders ensure training, equipment, and personnel are ready; document and share SOPs; know your people and help them grow.
- *"People don't quit companies. They leave managers."*

# Be Proud, But Never Satisfied

- Strive for continuous improvement—**BE PROUD, BUT NEVER SATISFIED.**

# Army Values & Expectations

- The seven Army Values are the bedrock for our service: **Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless Service, Honor, Integrity, and Personal Courage**.
- Ethical behavior and moral conduct on and off duty must be above reproach.

- Abide by Army grooming standards and local policies.
- Your appearance and bearing reflect on the Army—set the example for others.

# Communication & Accountability

- Use all available means (calls, texts, email) to communicate; respond promptly.

---

# Job Performance & Growth

I destroy them."
