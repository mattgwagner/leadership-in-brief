# Leadership in Brief

## A few notes from my foxhole

> Leadership is influencing people—by providing purpose, direction and motivation—while operating to accomplish the mission and improving the organization. Influencing means getting people to do what you want them to do. Through your words and example, you must communicate purpose, direction and motivation. Purpose gives Soldiers a reason to do things. You must earn their trust and they know from experience that you care about them. Soldiers want direction. They want to be given challenging tasks, training in how to accomplish them and the resources necessary to do them well. Motivation gives subordinates the will to do everything they can to accomplish a mission. Motivate your Soldiers by giving them missions that are challenging. Leaders motivate their Soldiers by the examples they set. The best leaders lead from the front. It is important to be where the action is.

# Setting Expectations: The Power of Counseling

Leadership is often made or broken by how well expectations are set from the start. In the Army, this is formalized through counseling sessions—especially the initial counseling.

- **Initial counseling** is where leaders and subordinates discuss roles, standards, and what success looks like.
- It's not just a checklist—done well, it's a conversation that builds trust, clarifies priorities, and opens the door for honest feedback.
- Clear expectations help prevent confusion, frustration, and underperformance down the road.

> "One of the greatest tools in a leader's kit bag is one-on-one counseling... When we don't provide subordinates with feedback, their professional growth is left up to chance."  
> — [From the Green Notebook](https://fromthegreennotebook.com/2019/05/23/turning-counseling-into-a-conversation/)

- The best counseling sessions are two-way conversations, not lectures. They invite reflection, feedback, and shared ownership of growth.

I destroy them."
